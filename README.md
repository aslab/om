# OM
The Operative Mind Architecture

The OM Architecture is a reference architecture for meta-capability in intelligent autonomous systems. It defines the functional processes, elements, relationships and data flows in a metacontroller. 

A key characteristic of the this architecture is that it can be applied to provide metacontrol capabilities to any controller fulfiling a minimal set of requirements, in order to improve its autonomy. The OM Architecture is intended to be universal: it has been developed in line with the aim of this work to be of general applicability to any system. The OM Architecture is independent both of the domain of the autonomous system (e.g. a mobile robot, an automated process plant, etc.), and the component platform in which the control system is implemented.
